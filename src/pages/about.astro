                            combinations created by the layering of robes or the contrast
                            between a garment's outer fabric and its lining.

                            By reflecting seasonal flora and landscapes in their
                            attire, people would "wear" the very transition of
                            the seasons. This refined sense of color remains a
                            timeless source of inspiration for modern design.

                            KASANE is a palette designed to "layer" these
                            traditional Japanese colors into the digital world.
                            We hope these ancient, beautiful hues will add a new
                            vibrancy to your web designs, applications, and
                            daily creations.

                            We focused not just on viewing colors, but on making
                            them <strong>"usable."</strong> By providing tools tailored
                            to modern workflows—such as Shopify integration, Tailwind
                            CSS configuration, and SVG generation—we elevate traditional
